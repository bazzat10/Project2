# PROJECT2 - Introducing Ella's Online Bookstore

### TECHNOLOGIES
Ella's Online Bookstore was written using Ruby, PostgreSQL, ActiveRecord(providing Object Relational Mapping), SQL, HTML and CSS

### APPROACH
* Theme - BOOKSTORE - ONLINE. As I usually deal with 'scholastics' having to order books for my children online.

* Rough Sketch of wireframes on paper.

* Rough Sketch of the tables-database and their relation to each other.
