# PROJECT2 - Introducing Ella's Online Bookstore

### Technologies Used
Ella's Online Bookstore was written in Ruby, PostgreSQL(Initially), ActiveRecord(providing Object Relational Mapping), SQL, HTML and CSS

### APPROACH
* Chosen - BOOKSTORE - ONLINE. As I usually deal with 'scholastics' having to order books for my children through online.

* Rough Sketch of wireframes. On paper.

* Rough Sketch of the tables-database and their relation to each other.

### FUNCTION - SOLUTION
* OUTPUT - User is able to browse the website / read the plot of the book / read comments about the book. Able to purchase multiple books or purchase multiple copies of the same book.
